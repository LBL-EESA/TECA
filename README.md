## The Toolkit for Extreme Climate Analysis
TECA is a collection of climate analysis algorithms geared toward extreme event detection and tracking implemented in a scalable parallel framework. The code has been successfully deployed and run at massive scales on current DOE supercomputers. TECA's core is written in modern C++ and exploits MPI + X parallelism where X is one of threads, OpenMP, or GPUs. The framework supports a number of parallel design patterns including distributed data parallelism and map-reduce. While modern C++ delivers the highest performance, Python bindings make the code approachable and easy to use.

### Documentation
The [TECA User's Guide](https://teca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the authorotative source for documentation on topics such as [installing TECA](https://teca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html), running TECA's [command line applications](https://teca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/applications.html), and [Python development](https://teca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python.html). The TECA source code is documented on our [Doxygen site](https://teca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doxygen/index.html).

### Tutorials
The [TECA tutorials](https://sourceforge.net/p/teca/TECA_tutorials) subversion repository contains slides from previous tutorials.

### Examples
The [TECA examples](https://github.com/LBL-EESA/TECA_examples) repository contains batch scripts and codes illustrating the use of TECA at scale.

### Python
The [TECA Python package]() is available on PyPi or by installing from sources. For more information see the [TECA User's Guide](https://teca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) sections on [installing TECA](https://teca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) and [Python development](https://teca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python.html).
