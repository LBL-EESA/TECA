# The TECA, Toolkit for Extreme Climate Analaysis
![Storm Tracks Generated by TECA](doc/images/tracks_crop_2.gif)

TECA(Toolkit for Extreme Climate Analysis) is a collection of climate analysis algorithms geared toward extreme event detection and tracking implemented in a scalable parallel framework. The core is written in modern c++ and uses MPI+thread for parallelism. The framework supports a number of parallel design patterns including distributed data parallelism and map-reduce. Python bindings make the high performance c++ code easy to use. TECA has been used up to 750k cores.
