/// Base class and default implementation for executives.
/**
 * Algorithm executives can control pipeline execution by providing
 * a series of requests. this allows for the executive to act as a load
 * balancer. the executive can for example partition requests across
 * spatial data, time steps, or file names. in an MPI parallel
 * setting the executive could coordinate this partitioning amongst
 * the ranks. However, the only requirement of an algorithm executive
 * is that it provide at least one non-empty request.
 *
 * The default implementation creates a single trivially non-empty
 * request containing the key "__request_empty = 0". This will cause
 * the pipeline to be executed once but will result in no data being
 * requested. Therefore when the default implementation is used
 * upstream algorithms must fill in the requests further to pull
 * data as needed.
