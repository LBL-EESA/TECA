TECA, Toolkit for Extreme Climate Analysis, Userâ€™s Guide
========================================================

TECA is a framework for parallel data analyitics on large scale systems built
by the DOE. TECA has algorithms for extreme event detection and analysis of
detected events.  Written in C++, TECA uses MPI and threads, to delivers state
of the art performance and scaling. It's Python bindings provide an easy way to
script analyisis suitable to any need and to develop new diagnostics. Paired
with NERSC's shifter solution Python based analytics using TECA can run at
largest scale on DOE HPC systems.
